			<p> As a second generation South Korean-American, kimchi jjigae was one of those common household staples
			for my family. Every other week, my mom or grandma always made a huge pot of it on the stove along with a pot of
			fresh rice when I got home from school. This was one of my favorite meals growing up, and when I eventually got 
			older and moved out, I missed not only my family but all of the delicious Korean food that I always took for granted.
			I have since tried many times to learn how to cook this dish, and when I visit home I always try to write down my grandma's 
			recipies while she's in the kitchen. While my food will never be as good as theirs, my grandma is always so proud of me 
			whenever I show her what I had made. </p>
